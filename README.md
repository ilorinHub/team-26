## About

The project is a Correspondonce Tracking system developed, using the ministry of education as a case study, to limit and eventually fade out the paper trail currently associated with the traditional correspondence systems of most organisations. The project aims to create a more efficient and streamlined process for tracking and managing internal and external communications within the ministry. By digitizing the correspondence, the organization will be able to reduce the amount of paper waste and increase speed of communication. The project also has an AI based, OCR model in embryo, being developed to help users no matter how technologically disadvantaged, be able to snap or scan the memo and have the text generated and sent to the identified party.
